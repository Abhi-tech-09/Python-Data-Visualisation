# Intelligent Inventory management

This project is a part of my python DWM experiment where we performed data handling techniques on the dataset and visualised the data to extract some meaningful information from it.

The data is stored in a google spreadsheet - [Link to dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p5ILLOrzH4rbeW4khK-_JVkk5I2O1HkUjmZIWasXOjA/edit?usp=sharing)

Used [Google spreadsheet API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts) to acess the data directly from the spreadsheet. 

Used [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to create graphs and charts.
